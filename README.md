## Planet defense

What will be a full game at some point, is now just a playable demo. Click any planet to spawn in a ship and use WASD to move and mouse click to shoot at incoming asteroids.

### Future features coming (once I am no longer drowning in coursework):
- Wave system for multiple waves of asteroids
- Hitpoints for planets and you have to defend them and stop them being destroyed
- Score system and leaderboard system?
- Multiplayer?!?! (now I am getting ambitious)
