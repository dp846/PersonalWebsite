# [Personal Website](https://danparsley.co.uk/)

A personal portfolio kind of website coded in HTML, CSS and (a lot of) JavaScript - in continuous development!

## Planet defense

What will be a full game at some point, is now just a playable demo. Click any planet to spawn in a ship and use WASD to move and mouse click to shoot at incoming asteroids. 

### Future features coming!!! (once I have significantly more spare time...):
- Wave system for multiple waves of asteroids
- Hitpoints for planets and you have to defend them and stop them being destroyed
- Perhaps a blog... I'm not sure...

## Credits:

Here's links to some of the inspiration for several aspects of the website where available - from the original template, to the black hole. This project would not be complete without them. A big thank you to the original creators. Please check out their work!
